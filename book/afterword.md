# Afterword

Thanks for reading! I hope this book was useful to you.

**Please** feel both welcomed and encouraged to ask me any clarifying questions,
or to [file an issue][0] if any of it is confusing or even send a PR if you have
improvements!

This has been a work of intensely deep focus and research for three and a half
years. It is a complex and difficult topic, and I am absolutely certain that I
have information and context that I haven’t sufficiently serialized for everyone
else to see.

Thank you for using `bitvec`. I am delighted that other people have found my
work both interesting and useful, and I’m glad that I’ve been able to help
people like you write better programs.
