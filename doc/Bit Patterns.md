# Bit Patterns

This document describes how bit slices describe memory, and how their pointer
structures are composed.

## Order Addressing

`<Msb0, u8>` and `<Lsb0, u8>` will always have the same representation in memory
on all machines. The wider orders will not.

## Pointer Representation

The bit pointer type `BitPtr<T>` is the fundamental component of the library. It
is a slice pointer with the capability to refine its concept of start and span
to bit-level granularity, allowing it to “point to” a single bit and count how
many bits after the pointed-to bit are included in the slice span.

The naïve implementation of such a pointer might be

```rust
struct BitPtr<T> {
  eltptr: *const T,
  elts: usize,
  first_bit: u8,
  last_bit: u8,
}
```

but this is three words wide, whereas a standard slice pointer is two. It also
has many invalid states, as indices into a slice of any type are traditionally
`usize`, and there only `usize::max_value() / 8` bytes in a fully widened bit
slice.

The next step might be for the struct to count bits, instead of elements, and
compute how many elements are in its domain based on the first live bit in the
slice and the count of all live bits. This eliminates the `last_bit` field,
folding it into `elts` to become `bits`,

```rust
struct BitPtr<T> {
  ptr: *const T,
  bits: usize,
  first_bit: u8,
}
```

but the width problem remains.

The (far too) clever solution is to fold the first-bit counter into the pointer
and length fields. This was not a problem with the last-bit counter, because
doing so brought the `bits` counter to match the indexing `usize` domain rather
than being far too large for it. However, there is not space to hold the
first-bit counter inside the other two elements!

Not without sacrificing range, anyway.

The naïve clever answer is to store both `bits` and `first_bit` in their
entirety inside the `len` field. However, the bit counter is a minimum of three
bits (indexing inside a `u8`) to a maximum of six bits (indexing inside a `u64`)
wide. On 32-bit systems, a bit slice over `u32` would lose five bits to bit
tracking, but only has two bits to spare.

The astute observer will note that all architectures “require” – more of a
strongly prefer, but will grudgingly allow violation – pointers to be aligned to
the width of their pointed type. That is, a pointer to a `u32` must have an
address that is an even multiple of four, and so addresses like `6` or `102` are
not valid places in memory for a `u32` to begin.

I personally find this easier to show than to write. The diagram below shows the
acceptable placements of each value type in a region of sixteen bytes, and the
number after each `[` glyph is an acceptable modulus for the address.

> ```text
> u64 |[0---------------------][8---------------------]
> u32 |[0---------][4---------][8---------][c---------]
> u16 |[0---][2---][4---][6---][8---][a---][c---][e---]
>  u8 |[0][1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][a][b][c][d][e][f]
> ```

That means that there is a bit available in the low end of the *pointer* for
every power of 2 element size above a byte. Narrowing from a byte to a bit still
requires three bits, which must be placed in the length field, but the low bits
of the pointer are able to take the rest.

The end result of this packing scheme is that bit slice pointers will have the
following representation, written in C++ because Rust does not have bitfield
syntax. The ranges in comments are the range of the field width.

```cpp
template <typename T>
struct BitPtr {
  size_t ptr_head : __builtin_ctzll(alignof(T)); // 0 ... 3
  size_t ptr_data : sizeof(uintptr_t) * 8
                  - __builtin_ctzll(alignof(T)); // 64/32 ... 61/29

  size_t len_head : 3;
  size_t len_bits : sizeof(size_t) * 8 - 3;
};
```

So, for any storage fundamental, its bitslice pointer representation has:

- the low `alignof` bits of the pointer for selecting a byte, and the rest of
  the pointer for selecting the fundamental. This is just a `*const u8` except
  the type remembers how to find the correctly aligned pointer.
- the lowest 3 bits of the length counter for selecting the bit under the head
  pointer
- the *next* log<sub>2</sub>(bit size) bits of the length counter index the
  first *dead* bit *after* the slice ends.
- the remaining high bits index the final *storage fundamental* of the slice,
  counting from the correctly aligned address in the pointer.

## Value Patterns

### Null Value

The null value, `ptr: 0, len: 0` is reserved as an invalid value of `BitPtr<T>`
so that it may be used as `Option<BitPtr<T>>::None`.

### Empty Slices

All pointers whose `bits` member is zero are considered empty. Empty slices are
not constrained in their `data` or `head` members, but the canonical empty slice
value uses `NonNull::<T>::dangling()` and `0`, respectively.

### Uninhabited Slices

The subset of empty slices with non-dangling `data` members are considered
uninhabited. All pointer structures retain their `data` value for their
lifetime; this allows owning supertypes like `BitBox` or `BitVec` to allocate a
region of storage without immediately beginning to populate it, and allows a
slice which has been shrunk to zero bits to still be considered a subset (by
address) of its parent slice.

### Inhabited Slices

All structures with a non-zero `bits` field are inhabited. The `bits` field may
range from zero (empty/uninhabited) to `!0` (fully extended).

## Memory Regions

A `BitPtr<T>` is translated to a `[T]` memory region using the `domain` module.
This module contains all the logic for determining which memory elements under a
`BitPtr<T>` are partially or fully inhabited by that bit slice.
