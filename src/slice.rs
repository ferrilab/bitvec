/*! A dynamically-sized view into individual bits of a memory region.

You can read the language’s [`slice` module documentation][std] here.

This module defines the [`BitSlice`] region, and all of its associated support
code.

`BitSlice` is the primary working type of this crate. It is a wrapper type over
`[T]` which enables you to view, manipulate, and take the address of individual
bits in memory. It behaves in every possible respect exactly like an ordinary
slice: it is dynamically-sized, and must be held by `&` or `&mut` reference,
just like `[T]`, and implements every inherent method and trait that `[T]` does,
to the absolute limits of what Rust permits.

The key to `BitSlice`’s powerful capability is that references to it use a
special encoding that store, in addition to the address of the base element and
the bit length, the index of the starting bit in the base element. This custom
reference encoding has some costs in what APIs are possible – for instance, Rust
forbids it from supporting `&mut BitSlice[index] = bool` write indexing – but in
exchange, enables it to be *far* more capable than any other bit-slice crate in
existence.

Because of the volume of code that must be written to match the `[T]` standard
API, this module is organized very differently than the slice implementation in
the `core` and `std` distribution libraries.

- the root module `slice` contains new APIs that have no counterpart in `[T]`
- `slice/api` contains reïmplementations of the `[T]` inherent methods
- `slice/iter` implements all of the iteration capability
- `slice/ops` implements the traits in `core::ops`
- `slice/proxy` implements the proxy reference used in place of `&mut bool`
- `slice/traits` implements all other traits not in `core::ops`
- lastly, `slice/tests` contains all the unit tests.

/** A slice of individual bits, anywhere in memory.

This is the main working type of the crate. It is analagous to `[bool]`, and is
written to be as close as possible to drop-in replacable for it. This type
contains most of the *methods* used to operate on memory, but it will rarely be
named directly in your code. You should generally prefer to use [`BitArray`] for
fixed-size arrays or [`BitVec`] for dynamic vectors, and use `&BitSlice`
references only where you would directly use `&[bool]` or `&[u8]` references
before using this crate.

As it is a slice wrapper, you are intended to work with this through references
(`&BitSlice<O, T>` and `&mut BitSlice<O, T>`) or through the other data
structures provided by `bitvec` that are implemented atop it. Once created,
references to `BitSlice` are guaranteed to work just like references to `[bool]`
to the fullest extent possible in the Rust language.

Every bit-vector crate can give you an opaque type that hides shift/mask
operations from you. `BitSlice` does far more than this: it offers you the full
Rust guarantees about reference behavior, including lifetime tracking,
mutability and aliasing awareness, and explicit memory control, *as well as* the
full set of tools and APIs available to the standard `[bool]` slice type.
`BitSlice` can arbitrarily split and subslice, just like `[bool]`. You can write
a linear consuming function and keep the patterns already know.

For example, to trim all the bits off either edge that match a condition, you
could write

```rust
use bitvec::prelude::*;

fn trim<O: BitOrder, T: BitStore>(
  bits: &BitSlice<O, T>,
  to_trim: bool,
) -> &BitSlice<O, T> {
  let stop = |b: &bool| *b != to_trim;
  let front = bits.iter().position(stop).unwrap_or(0);
  let back = bits.iter().rposition(stop).unwrap_or(0);
  &bits[front ..= back]
}
# assert_eq!(trim(bits![0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0], false), bits![1, 1, 0, 1]);
```

to get behavior something like
`trim(&BitSlice[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0], false) == &BitSlice[1, 1, 0, 1]`.

# Documentation

All APIs that mirror something in the standard library will have an `Original`
section linking to the corresponding item. All APIs that have a different
signature or behavior than the original will have an `API Differences` section
explaining what has changed, and how to adapt your existing code to the change.

These sections look like this:

# Original

[`slice`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html)

# API Differences

The slice type `[bool]` has no type parameters. `BitSlice<O, T>` has two: one
for the memory type used as backing storage, and one for the order of bits
within that memory type.

`&BitSlice<O, T>` is capable of producing `&bool` references to read bits out
of its memory, but is not capable of producing `&mut bool` references to write
bits *into* its memory. Any `[bool]` API that would produce a `&mut bool` will
instead produce a [`BitMut<O, T>`] proxy reference.

# Behavior

`BitSlice` is a wrapper over `[T]`. It describes a region of memory, and must be
handled indirectly. This is most commonly through the reference types
`&BitSlice` and `&mut BitSlice`, which borrow memory owned by some other value
in the program. These buffers can be directly owned by the sibling types
`BitBox`, which behavios like `Box<[T]>`, and `BitVec`, which behaves like
`Vec<T>`. It cannot be used as the type parameter to a standard-library-provided
handle type.

The `BitSlice` region provides access to each individual bit in the region, as
if each bit had a memory address that you could use to dereference it. It packs
each logical bit into exactly one bit of storage memory, just like
[`std::bitset`] and [`std::vector<bool>`] in C++.

# Type Parameters

`BitSlice` has two type parameters which propagate through nearly every public
API in the crate. These are very important to its operation, and your choice
of type arguments informs nearly every part of this library’s behavior.

## `T: BitStore`

This is the simpler of the two parameters. It refers to the integer type used to
hold bits. It must be one of the Rust unsigned integer fundamentals: `u8`,
`u16`, `u32`, `usize`, and on 64-bit systems only, `u64`. In addition, it can
also be the `Cell<N>` wrapper over any of those, or their equivalent types in
`core::sync::atomic`. Unless you know you need to have `Cell` or atomic
properties, though, you should use a plain integer.

The default type argument is `usize`.

The argument you choose is used as the basis of a `[T]` slice, over which the
`BitSlice` view type is placed. `BitSlice<_, T>` is subject to all of the rules
about alignment that `[T]` is. If you are working with in-memory representation
formats, chances are that you already have a `T` type with which you’ve been
working, and should use it here.

If you are only using this crate to discard the seven wasted bits per `bool`
of a collection of `bool`s, and are not too concerned about the in-memory
representation, then you should use the default type argument of `usize`. This
is because most processors work best when moving an entire `usize` between
memory and the processor itself, and using a smaller type may cause it to slow
down.

## `O: BitOrder`

This is the more complex parameter. It has a default argument which, like
`usize`, is the good-enough choice when you do not explicitly need to control
the representation of bits in memory.

This parameter determines how to index the bits within a single memory element
`T`. Computers all agree that in a slice of elements `T`, the element with the
lower index has a lower memory address than the element with the higher index.
But the individual bits within an element do not have addresses, and so there is
no uniform standard of which bit is the zeroth, which is the first, which is the
penultimate, and which is the last.

To make matters even more confusing, there are two predominant ideas of
in-element ordering that often *correlate* with the in-element *byte* ordering
of integer types, but are in fact wholly unrelated! `bitvec` provides these two
main orders as types for you, and if you need a different one, it also provides
the tools you need to make your own.

### Least Significant Bit Comes First

This ordering, named the [`Lsb0`] type, indexes bits within an element by
placing the `0` index at the least significant bit (numeric value `1`) and the
final index at the most significant bit (numeric value `T::min_value()`, for
signed integers on most machines).

For example, this is the ordering used by the [TCP wire format], and by most C
compilers to lay out bit-field struct members on little-endian **byte**-ordered
machines.

### Most Significant Bit Comes First

This ordering, named the [`Msb0`] type, indexes bits within an element by
placing the `0` index at the most significant bit (numeric value `T::min_value()`
for most signed integers) and the final index at the least significant bit
(numeric value `1`).

This is the ordering used by most C compilers to lay out bit-field struct
members on big-endian **byte**-ordered machines.

### Default Ordering

Because the ordering does not matter to performance, and users who need to
explicitly control memory representation will provide an order *anyway*, the
default ordering type follows the C-compiler convention. The ordering that
matches your target’s C-compiler bitfield layout is reëxported as
[`bitvec::prelude::Local`], and used as the default argument. If you don’t
already know that you need a specific ordering, you should use `Local` and not
worry too much about it.

# Safety

`BitSlice` is designed to never introduce new memory unsafety that you did not
provide yourself, either before or during the use of this crate. Bugs do, and
have, occured, and you are encouraged to submit any discovered flaw as a defect
report.

The `&BitSlice` reference type uses a private encoding scheme to hold all the
information needed in its stack value. This encoding is **not** part of the
public API of the library, and is not binary-compatible with `&[T]`.
Furthermore, in order to satisfy Rust’s requirements about alias conditions,
`BitSlice` performs type transformations on the `T` parameter to ensure that it
never creates the potential for undefined behavior.

You must never attempt to type-cast a reference to `BitSlice` in any way. You
must not use `mem::transmute` with `BitSlice` anywhere in its type arguments.
You must not use `as`-casting to convert between `*BitSlice` and any other type.
You must not attempt to modify the binary representation of a `&BitSlice`
reference value. These actions will all lead to runtime memory unsafety, are
(hopefully) likely to induce a program crash, and may possibly cause undefined
behavior at compile-time.

Everything in the `BitSlice` public API, even the `unsafe` parts, are guaranteed
to have no more unsafety than their equivalent parts in the standard library.
All `unsafe` APIs will have documentation explicitly detailing what the API
requires you to uphold in order for it to function safely and correctly. All
safe APIs will do so themselves.

# Performance

Like the standard library’s `[T]` slice, `BitSlice` is designed to be very easy
to use safely, while supporting `unsafe` when necessary. Rust has a powerful
optimizing engine, and `BitSlice` will frequently be compiled to have zero
runtime cost. Where it is slower, it will not be significantly slower than a
manual replacement.

As the machine instructions operate on registers rather than bits, your choice
of `T: BitOrder` type parameter can influence your slice’s performance. Using
larger register types means that slices can gallop over completely-filled
interior elements faster, while narrower register types permit more graceful
handling of subslicing and aliased splits.

# Construction

`BitSlice` views of memory can be constructed over borrowed data in a number of
ways. As this is a reference-only type, it can only ever be built by borrowing
an existing memory buffer and taking temporary control of your program’s view of
the region.

## Macro Constructor

`BitSlice` buffers can be constructed at compile-time through the [`bits!`]
macro. This macro accepts a superset of the `vec!` arguments, and creates an
appropriate buffer in your program’s static memory.

```rust
use bitvec::prelude::*;

let static_borrow = bits![0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1];
let mutable_static: &mut BitSlice<_, _> = bits![mut 0; 8];

assert_ne!(static_borrow, mutable_static);
mutable_static.clone_from_bitslice(static_borrow);
assert_eq!(static_borrow, mutable_static);
```

Note that, despite constructing a `static mut` binding, the `bits![mut …]` call
is not `unsafe`, as the constructed symbol is hidden and only accessible by the
sole `&mut` reference returned by the macro call.

## Borrowing Constructors

The functions [`from_element`], [`from_element_mut`], [`from_slice`], and
[`from_slice_mut`] take references to existing memory, and construct `BitSlice`
references over them. These are the most basic ways to borrow memory and view it
as bits.

```rust
use bitvec::prelude::*;

let data = [0u16; 3];
let local_borrow = BitSlice::<Lsb0, _>::from_slice(&data);

let mut data = [0u8; 5];
let local_mut = BitSlice::<Lsb0, _>::from_slice_mut(&mut data);
```

## Trait Method Constructors

The [`BitView`] trait implements `.view_bits::<O>()` and `.view_bits_mut::<O>()`
methods on elements, arrays not larger than 32 elements, and slices. This trait,
imported in the crate prelude, is *probably* the easiest way for you to borrow
memory.

```rust
use bitvec::prelude::*;

let data = [0u32; 5];
let trait_view = data.view_bits::<Msb0>();

let mut data = 0usize;
let trait_mut = data.view_bits_mut::<Msb0>();
```

## Owned Bit Slices

If you wish to take ownership of a memory region and enforce that it is always
viewed as a `BitSlice` by default, you can use one of the [`BitArray`],
[`BitBox`], or [`BitVec`] types, rather than pairing ordinary buffer types with
the borrowing constructors.

```rust
use bitvec::prelude::*;

let slice = bits![0; 27];
let array = bitarr![Local, u8; 0; 10];
# #[cfg(feature = "alloc")] fn allocs() {
let boxed = bitbox![0; 10];
let vec = bitvec![0; 20];
# } #[cfg(feature = "alloc")] allocs();

// arrays always round up
assert_eq!(array.as_bitslice(), slice[.. 16]);
# #[cfg(feature = "alloc")] fn allocs2() {
# let slice = bits![0; 27];
# let boxed = bitbox![0; 10];
# let vec = bitvec![0; 20];
assert_eq!(boxed.as_bitslice(), slice[.. 10]);
assert_eq!(vec.as_bitslice(), slice[.. 20]);
# } #[cfg(feature = "alloc")] allocs2();
```

	/// Sets the bit value at the given position.
	///
	/// # Parameters
	///
	/// - `&mut self`
	/// - `index`: The bit index to set. It must be in the range `0 ..
	///   self.len()`.
	/// - `value`: The value to be set, `true` for `1` and `false` for `0`.
	///
	/// # Effects
	///
	/// If `index` is valid, then the bit to which it refers is set to `value`.
	///
	/// # Panics
	///
	/// This method panics if `index` is outside the slice domain.
	///
	/// # Examples
	///
	/// ```rust
	/// use bitvec::prelude::*;
	///
	/// let mut data = 0u8;
	/// let bits = data.view_bits_mut::<Msb0>();
	///
	/// assert!(!bits.get(7).unwrap());
	/// bits.set(7, true);
	/// assert!(bits.get(7).unwrap());
	/// assert_eq!(data, 1);
	/// ```
	///
	/// This example panics when it attempts to set a bit that is out of bounds.
	///
	/// ```rust,should_panic
	/// use bitvec::prelude::*;
	///
	/// let bits = BitSlice::<Local, usize>::empty_mut();
	/// bits.set(0, false);

	/// Sets a bit at an index, without checking boundary conditions.
	///
	/// This is generally not recommended; use with caution! For a safe
	/// alternative, see [`set`].
	///
	/// # Parameters
	///
	/// - `&mut self`
	/// - `index`: The bit index to set. It must be in the range `0 ..
	///   self.len()`. It will not be checked.
	///
	/// # Effects
	///
	/// The bit at `index` is set to `value`.
	///
	/// # Safety
	///
	/// This method is **not** safe. It performs raw pointer arithmetic to seek
	/// from the start of the slice to the requested index, and set the bit
	/// there. It does not inspect the length of `self`, and it is free to
	/// perform out-of-bounds memory *write* access.
	///
	/// Use this method **only** when you have already performed the bounds
	/// check, and can guarantee that the call occurs with a safely in-bounds
	/// index.
	///
	/// # Examples
	///
	/// This example uses a bit slice of length 2, and demonstrates
	/// out-of-bounds access to the last bit in the element.
	///
	/// ```rust
	/// use bitvec::prelude::*;
	///
	/// let mut data = 0u8;
	/// let bits = &mut data.view_bits_mut::<Msb0>()[2 .. 4];

	///
	/// let (_, noalias, _): (_, &Bs<u8>, _) =
	///   subslice.bit_domain().region().unwrap();
	/// # }
	/// ```
	///
	/// The `noalias` reference, which has memory type `u8`, assumes that it can
	/// act as an `&u8` reference: unsynchronized loads are permitted, as no
	/// handle exists which is capable of modifying the middle bit of `data`.
	/// This means that LLVM is permitted to issue loads from memory *wherever*
	/// it wants in the block during which `noalias` is live, as all loads are
	/// equivalent.
	///
	/// Use of the `bits` or `subslice` handles, which are still live for the
	/// lifetime of `noalias`, to issue [`.set_aliased`] calls into the middle
	/// element introduce **undefined behavior**. `bitvec` permits safe code to
	/// introduce this undefined behavior solely because it requires deliberate
	/// opt-in – you must start from atomic data; this cannot occur when `data`
	/// is non-atomic – and use of the shared-mutation facility simultaneously
	/// with the unaliasing view.
	///
	/// The [`.set_aliased`] method is speculative, and will be marked as

# Lifetimes

- `'a`: The lifetime of the returned bitslice handle. This must be no longer

  dangle.

# Type Parameters

- `O`: The ordering of bits within elements `T`.
- `T`: The type of each memory element in the backing storage region.

# Parameters

- `addr`: The base address of the memory region that the `BitSlice` covers.
- `head`: The index of the first live bit in `*addr`, at which the `BitSlice`
  begins. This is required to be in the range `0 .. T::Mem::BITS`.
- `bits`: The number of live bits, beginning at `head` in `*addr`, that the
  `BitSlice` contains. This must be no greater than `BitSlice::MAX_BITS`.

# Returns

If the input parameters are valid, this returns `Some` shared reference to a
`BitSlice`. The failure conditions causing this to return `None` are:

- `head` is not less than [`T::Mem::BITS`]
- `bits` is greater than [`BitSlice::<O, T>::MAX_BITS`]
- `addr` is not adequately aligned to `T`
- `addr` is so high in the memory space that the region wraps to the base of the

# Safety
