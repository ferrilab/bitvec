/*! Test case for [Issue #33], provided by GitHub user [@jonas-schievink].

This report discovered an error in the implementation of `BitVec::reserve`,
which caused it to fail to reällocate in certain conditions.

The error was that the `reserve` method was testing the reservation amount
passed in to `Vec::reserve` against the currently-allocated *capacity*, not the
currently-occupied *element length*. `Vec::reserve` expects the difference to be
against the element length, so `BitVec::reserve` was estimating too few elements
and `Vec::reserve` did not see the request amount as requiring a reällocation.

`BitVec::reserve` now tests the reservation amount against the current element
length, which produces the correct reservation request for `Vec::reserve`,
fixing the error.
