/*! Bitslice pointer encoding

This module defines the in-memory representation of the handle to a `BitSlice`
region. This structure is crate-internal, and defines the methods required to
store a `BitSlice` pointer in memory and retrieve values from it suitable for
work.

Currently, this module is absolutely forbidden for export outside the crate, and
its implementation cannot be relied upon. Future work *may* choose to stabilize
the encoding, and make it available, but this work is not a priority for the
project.

/** Bit-precision slice pointer encoding.

Rust slices use a pointer/length encoding to represent regions of memory.
References to slices of data, `&[T]`, have the ABI layout `(*const T, usize)`.

`BitPtr` encodes a base address, a first-bit index, and a length counter, into
the Rust slice reference layout using this structure, permitting `bitvec` to use
an opaque reference type in its implementation of Rust interfaces that require
references, rather than immediate value types.

# Layout

This structure is a more complex version of the `*const T`/`usize` tuple that
Rust uses to represent slices throughout the language. It breaks the pointer and
counter fundamentals into sub-field components. Rust does not have bitfield
syntax, so the below description of the structure layout is in C++.

```cpp
template <typename T>
struct BitPtr {
  uintptr_t ptr_head : __builtin_ctzll(alignof(T));
  uintptr_t ptr_addr : sizeof(uintptr_T) * 8 - __builtin_ctzll(alignof(T));

  size_t len_head : 3;
  size_t len_bits : sizeof(size_t) * 8 - 3;
};
```

This means that the `BitPtr<T>` has three *logical* fields, stored in four
segments across the two *structural* fields of the type. The widths and
placements of each segment are functions of the size of `*const T` and `usize`,
and of the alignment of the `T` referent buffer element type.

# Fields

This section describes the purpose, semantic meaning, and layout of the three
logical fields.

## Base Address

The address of the base element in a memory region is stored in all but the
lowest bits of the `ptr` field. An aligned pointer to `T` will always have its
lowest log<sub>2</sub>(byte width) bits zeroed, so those bits can be used to
store other information, as long as they are erased before dereferencing the
address as a pointer to `T`.

## Head Bit Index

For any referent element type `T`, the selection of a single bit within the
element requires log<sub>2</sub>(byte width) bits to select a byte within the
element `T`, and another three bits to select a bit within the selected byte.

|Type |Alignment|Trailing Zeros|Count Bits|
|:----|--------:|-------------:|---------:|
|`u8` |        1|             0|         3|
|`u16`|        2|             1|         4|
|`u32`|        4|             2|         5|
|`u64`|        8|             3|         6|

The index of the first live bit in the base element is split to have its three
least significant bits stored in the least significant edge of the `len` field,
and its remaining bits stored in the least significant edge of the `ptr` field.

## Length Counter

All but the lowest three bits of the `len` field are used to store a counter of
live bits in the referent region. When this is zero, the region is empty.
Because it is missing three bits, a `BitPtr` has only ⅛ of the index space of
a `usize` value.

# Significant Values

The following values represent significant instances of the `BitPtr` type.

## Null Slice

The fully-zeroed slot is not a valid member of the `BitPtr<T>` type; it is
reserved as the sentinel value for `Option::<BitPtr<T>>::None`.

## Canonical Empty Slice

All pointers with a `bits: 0` logical field are empty. Pointers used to maintain
ownership of heap buffers are not permitted to erase their `addr` field, but
unowning pointers may do so. When an unowning pointer becomes empty, it may
replace its `addr` with the `NonNull::<T>::dangling()` value.

All empty pointers are equivalent to each other.

### Uninhabited Slices

Any empty pointer with a non-`dangling()` base address is considered to be an
uninhabited region.

# Type Parameters

- `T`: The memory type of the referent region. `BitPtr<T>` is a refined `*[T]`
  slice pointer, and operates on memory in terms of the `T` type for access and
  pointer calculation.

# Safety

A `BitPtr` must never be constructed such that the element addressed by
`self.pointer().to_const().offset(self.elements())` causes an addition overflow.
This will be checked in `new()`.

It is difficult to cause an arithmetic overflow with pointer offsets, as most
targets divide the address space such that programs see a highest address of
`0x7FFF…`. This restriction is inherited from restrictions in the distribution
collection libraries, which have studied these problems extensively and are
reasonable sources of trustworthy plagiarism.

# Undefined Behavior

Values of this type are incompatible with slice pointers. Transmutation of these
values into any other type will result in an incorrect program, and permit the
program to begin illegal or undefined behaviors. This type may never be
manipulated in any way by user code outside of the APIs it offers to this crate;
it certainly may not be seen or observed by other crates.
