# Dedication

I begain working on `bitvec` shortly before I was told that my father had been
diagnosed with cancer for the third time. Developing the library gave me
something into which to sink my attention and keep my mind from dwelling on his
rapidly-progressing illness. I wrote the core pointer representation that
enables `bitvec`’s current behavior at his side, in the last days that he
remained conscious.

I never had the chance to explain to my dad what I was building. By the time it
was developed enough to be worth explaining, he had lost too much of his brain
to understand me. More than anything I’ve done for my employers, `bitvec` is the
work of which I’m most proud, and which I most wish he could have seen.

The `bitvec` project is dedicated to the memory of my father, George M. Payne,
who inspired me to build quality work, supported my search to find my talents,
and taught me to work for the benefit of others beyond myself.
