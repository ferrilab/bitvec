/*! Memory access guards.

[`bitvec`] allows a program to produce handles over memory that do not logically
alias their bits, but may alias in hardware. This module provides a unified
interface for memory accesses that can be specialized to handle aliased and
unaliased access events.

The [`BitAccess`] trait provides capabilities to access bits in memory elements
through shared references, and its implementations are responsible for
coördinating synchronization and contention as needed.

The [`BitSafe`] trait abstracts over wrappers to the [`Cell`] and [atomic] types
that forbid writing through their references, even when other references to the
same location may write.

/** Abstracts over the instructions used when accessing a memory location.

This trait provides functions to manipulate bits in a referent memory register
through the appropriate access instructions, so that use sites elsewhere in the
crate can select their required behavior without changing their interface.

This is automatically implemented for all types that permit shared/mutable
memory access to memory registers through the [`radium`] crate. Its use is
constrained in the [`store`] module.

This trait is only ever used by [`bitvec`] internals, and is never exposed
outside the crate. It must be marked as public so that it can be used as an
associated item in [`BitStore`], even though it is never made accessible.
