/*! Ordering of bits within register elements.

[`bitvec`] data structures are parametric over any ordering of bits within a
register type. The [`BitOrder`] trait translates a cursor position (indicated by
the [`BitIdx`] type) to an electrical position (indicated by the [`BitPos`]
type) within that register, thereby defining the order of traversal over a
register.

Implementors of [`BitOrder`] are required to satisfy a set of requirements on
their transform function, and must have identical behavior to the
default-provided trait functions if they choose to override them for
performance. These can all be proven by use of the [`verify`] or
[`verify_for_type`] functions in the implementorâ€™s test suite.

[`BitOrder`] is a stateless trait, and implementors should be zero-sized types.

/** An ordering over a register.

# Usage

[`bitvec`] structures store and operate on semantic index counters, not
electrical bit positions. The [`BitOrder::at`] function takes a semantic
ordering, [`BitIdx`], and produces a corresponding electrical position,
[`BitPos`].

# Safety

If your implementation violates any of the requirements on these functions, then
the program will become incorrect, and have unspecified behavior. The best-case
outcome is that operations relying on your implementation will crash the
program; the worst-case is that memory access will silently become corrupt.

You are responsible for adhering to the requirements of these functions. There
are verification functions that you can use in your test suite; however, it is
not yet possible to prove correctness at compile-time.

This is an `unsafe trait` to implement because you are responsible for upholding
the stated requirements.

The implementations of `BitOrder` are trusted to drive safe code, and once data
leaves a `BitOrder` implementation, it is considered safe to use as the basis
for interaction with memory.

# Verification

The [`verify`] and [`verify_for_type`] functions are available for your test
suites. They ensure that a `BitOrder` implementation satisfies the requirements
when invoked for a given register type.

# Examples

Implementations are not required to remain contiguous over a register. This
example swizzles the high and low halves of each byte, but any translation is
valid as long as it satisfies the strict one-to-one requirement of
index-to-position.

pub unsafe trait BitOrder: 'static {
	/// Converts a semantic bit index into an electrical bit position.
	///
	/// This function is the basis of the trait, and must adhere to a number of
	/// requirements in order for an implementation to be correct.
	///
	/// # Type Parameters
	///
	/// - `R`: The register type that the index and position govern.
	///
	/// # Parameters
	///
	/// - `index`: The semantic index of a bit within a register `R`.
	///
	/// # Returns
	///
	/// The electrical position of the indexed bit within the register `R`. See
	/// the [`BitPos`] documentation for what electrical positions are
	/// considered to mean.
	///
	/// # Requirements
	///
	/// This function must satisfy the following requirements for all possible
	/// input and output values, for all possible `R` type parameters:
	///
	/// ## Totality
	///
	/// This function must be able to accept every input in the range
	/// [`BitIdx::ZERO`] to [`BitIdx::LAST`], and produce a value in the same
	/// range as a [`BitPos`].
	///
	/// ## Bijection
	///
	/// There must be an exactly one-to-one correspondence between input value
	/// and output value. No input index may choose its output from a set of
	/// more than one position, and no output position may be produced by more
	/// than one input index.
	///
	/// ## Purity
	///
	/// The translation from index to position must be consistent for the
	/// lifetime of *at least* all data structures in the program. This function
	/// *may* refer to global state, but that state **must** be immutable while
	/// any [`bitvec`] data structures exist, and must not be used to violate
	/// the totality or bijection requirements.
	///
	/// ## Output Validity
	///
	/// The produced [`BitPos`] must be within the valid range of that type.
	/// Call sites of this function will not take any steps to constrain or
	/// check the return value. If you use `unsafe` code to produce an invalid
	/// `BitPos`, the program is incorrect, and will likely crash.
	///
	/// # Usage
	///
	/// This function is only ever called with input values in the valid
	/// [`BitIdx`] range. Implementors are not required to consider any values
	/// outside this range in their function body.
	///
	/// [`BitIdx`]: crate::index::BitIdx
	/// [`BitIdx::LAST`]: crate::index::BitIdx::LAST
	/// [`BitIdx::ZERO`]: crate::index::BitIdx::ZERO

	/// [`bitvec`]: crate
	fn at<R>(index: BitIdx<R>) -> BitPos<R>
	where R: BitRegister;

	/// Converts a semantic bit index into a one-hot selector mask.
	///
	/// This is an optional function; a default implementation is provided for
	/// you. If you choose to override it, your implementation **must** retain
	/// the behavior of the default implementation.
	///
	/// The default implementation calls [`Self::at`] to convert the index into
	/// a position, then turns that position into a selector mask with the
	/// expression `1 << pos`. `BitOrder` implementations may choose to provide
	/// a faster mask production here, as long as they match this behavior.
	///
	/// # Type Parameters
	///
	/// - `R`: The register type that the index and selector govern.
	///
	/// # Parameters
	///
	/// - `index`: The semantic index of a bit within a register `R`.
	///
	/// # Returns
	///
	/// A one-hot selector mask for the bit indicated by the index value.
	///
	/// # Requirements
	///
	/// A one-hot encoding means that there is exactly one bit set in the
	/// produced value. It must be equivalent to `1 << Self::at::<R>(index)`.
	///
	/// As with `at`, this function must produce a unique mapping from each
	/// legal index in the [`BitIdx`] domain to a one-hot value of `R`.

	/// register `R`.
	///
	/// The default implementation of this function traverses the index range,
	/// converting each index into a single-bit selector with [`Self::select`]
	/// and accumulating into a combined register value.
	///
	/// # Type Parameters
	///
	/// - `R`: The register type for which the mask is built.
	///
	/// # Parameters
	///
	/// - `from`: The inclusive starting index for the mask.
	/// - `upto`: The exclusive ending index for the mask.
	///
	/// # Returns
	///
	/// A bit-mask with all bits corresponding to the input index range set high
	/// and all others set low.
	///
	/// # Requirements
	///
	/// This function must always be equivalent to this expression:
	///
	/// ```rust,ignore
	/// (from .. upto)
	///   .map(Self::select::<R>)
	///   .fold(0, |mask, sel| mask | sel)
